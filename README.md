# GLWidgetTest
OpenTK GLWidget example code. Modified for GTK3.

This is a minimal example program of an OpenGL 3.3 context in a GTK#3 window. The GTK#2 project included in the repository does not function.

### Running
Restore NuGet packages and compile. The sample requires GTK3 to be installed. If you're using Windows, get the libraries here: https://download.gnome.org/binaries/win32/gtk-sharp/2.99/gtk-sharp-2.99.3.msi and extract this into the binary folder: https://github.com/opentk/opentk/files/659016/share.zip

Run "GLWidgetTestGTK3". WASD to move, hold right click to rotate and move.
